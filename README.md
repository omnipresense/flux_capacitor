These are the resources presented in and used for the Arduino Project Hub posting [Hack of the Future](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/jimwhitfield/hack-of-the-future-a-flux-capacitor-with-omnipresense-radar-c6e954?ref=search&ref_id=hack%20of%20the%20future&offset=0)

The flux_capacitor.ino arduino project itself is the final working Arduino project for displaying the speed on the 7-segment LEDs.  It uses the SevSeg library to drive the 7-segment LEDs, and it makes use of the built-in Serial library for reading speed data from the RX pin.  (As mentioned in Step 2 of the posting, using the native Serial abilities on the TX and RX pins is superior to using SoftwareSerial on pins 10 and 11.  However, if the baud rate is set low enough and the sensor is used in its default configuration of sending out only a speed report (not "multiple objects" nor raw or fft results) and not at an overly fast sampling rate, SoftwareSerial might be sufficient.)
